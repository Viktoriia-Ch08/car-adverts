The project was created based on a test task. The main goal was to create a car
rental application.

The application contains:

- Home page with a description of the services provided by the company.
- A catalog of cars of various configurations, which the user can filter by
  brand and price per hour of car rental.
- A page with ads that have been added to the user's favorites.
